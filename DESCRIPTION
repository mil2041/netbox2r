Description: NetBox is a network-based approach that combines prior knowledge 
    with a network clustering algorithm. The algorithm allows for the 
    identification of functional modules and allows for combining multiple 
    data types, such as mutations and copy number alterations. NetBox performs 
    network analysis on human interaction networks, and comes pre-loaded with 
    a Human Interaction Network (HIN) derived from four literature curated 
    data sources, including the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD), 
    Reactome, NCI-Nature Pathway Interaction (PID) Database, and the MSKCC 
    Cancer Cell Map.
